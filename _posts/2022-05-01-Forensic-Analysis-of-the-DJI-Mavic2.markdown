<h2>Forensic Analysis of the DJI Mavic 2</h2>
<h3>Analysis of Third Party Drone Applications</h3>

<p align="justify">The growing prevalence of counterfeit electronic devices is an issue that is unaddressed despite the numerous recorded cases of devices being sold under false pretenses that are later found to be exfiltrating data to threat actors. This, coupled with the growing amount of people who have access to and rely on smartphones makes highly coveted devices, such as the iPhone, a target for duplications. This report seeks to address potential forensic artifacts and security threats found while analyzing data off one of the most popular iPhone 12 Pro dupes currently on the market - the GooPhone 12 Pro.</p>
